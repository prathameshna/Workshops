        <h3>Devourin's Contactless Technology May Be the New Normal for Hotels and Restaurants Post Lockdown</h3>
        <p>Last Updated: May 19, 2020, 12:40 PM IST</p>

            As the hospitality industry prepares to welcome its patrons back after the COVID 19 situation recedes, a ‘new normal’ is introduced encouraging social distancing and taking contactless technology from Devourin to a centre stage.
            <br>&emsp;&ensp;
            The coronavirus pandemic has managed to confine a large number of people to the safety of their homes, crippling the thriving business of all hotels across the country. When the worst of this situation passes, life will return to normalcy but scepticism about the safety of travel and stay will dictate the pace at which business returns to pre-lockdown levels. The fear of infection will impact people’s decision to step out of homes.
            <br>&emsp;&ensp;
            Deepak Nathani, Managing Director, Devourin, who is also the former COO and Co-founder of Cybage Software, explains “The hospitality industry is suddenly grappling with the unprecedented impact of COVID 19. There is a need for a completely new approach to regain the confidence of guests. Spark from Devourin, a suite of touchless ordering solutions is a perfect solution and the true need of the hour”.
