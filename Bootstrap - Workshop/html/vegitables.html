                            <strong>Celeriac</strong> has green leaves and stalks that grow above ground and roots with a rough, brown skin that grow underground. While farmers grow celery for its edible leaves and stalks, they grow celeriac for its roots.
                        Some people refer to celeriac as celery root, but it is not the root of a celery stalk.
                            
                            Other names for celeriac are knob celery and turnip-rooted celery. It belongs to the same plant family as carrots and is related to celery, parsley, and parsnips.

                            <strong>Spaghetti squash</strong> can be cooked in a variety of ways, including baking, boiling, steaming, or microwaving.[2] Once cooked the flesh of this fruit can be prepared in a way that its “strands” look like and are as long as traditional spaghetti noodles.
                            It can be served with or without sauce as a substitute for pasta, and its seeds can be roasted, similar to pumpkin seeds.

                            A <strong>mushroom</strong> or toadstool is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground, on soil, or on its food source.
                            The standard for the name "mushroom" is the cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus; hence the word "mushroom" is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes) that have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae, sing. lamella) on the underside of the cap. "Mushroom" also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems, 
                            therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. These gills produce microscopic spores that help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface.
